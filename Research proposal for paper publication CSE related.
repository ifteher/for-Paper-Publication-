Title: Developing Sustainable Computing Solutions: Energy-Efficient Algorithms and Green Data Centers. 

1.	Introduction
The increasing reliance on digital technology, from high-performance computing to mobile devices, has raised urgent concerns about energy consumption and environmental impact. This proposal focuses on three critical areas within sustainable computing:
i.	Energy-Efficient Algorithms optimize computational resources, reducing overall energy consumption.
ii.	Green Computing for Data Centers to lessen environmental impact by minimizing power usage and enhancing resource efficiency. iii. Low Power Computing for Mobile Devices to extend battery life and maintain performance on increasingly popular mobile platforms.
Our research aims to develop sustainable solutions, enhancing efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint of modern computing infrastructures.
2.	Objectives
Develop Energy-Efficient Algorithms: Create algorithms that use computational resources efficiently, reducing the power required to perform operations.
Green Data Center Solutions: Investigate techniques to lower power use in large-scale data centers, emphasizing efficient cooling systems and resource allocation.
Low Power Techniques for Mobile Devices: Develop strategies to extend battery life on mobile devices without compromising their performance.
3.	Literature Review
Energy-Efficient Algorithms: Studies show that optimizing algorithms for efficiency can reduce power consumption significantly, though there remains a challenge in balancing energy savings with high-performance requirements ([1], [2]).
Green Computing for Data Centers: Data centers are known to consume substantial electricity. Solutions such as optimized cooling and energy management strategies are being explored, though integrating these into current infrastructure is challenging ([3], [4]).
Low Power Computing for Mobile Devices: Techniques such as dynamic voltage scaling and optimized task scheduling have shown effectiveness, yet continual advancements in mobile hardware demand further refinement ([5]).
